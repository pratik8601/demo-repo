[[_requirements]]
== 3. Requirements
In the following section, we have given various requirements for a phone charger that we will need for our design.

[[_input_output_requirements]]
=== 3.1. Input Output Requirements
* *Input*: Type C plug, 100-230V, 50-60Hz, 0.6 A.
* *Output*: 5V, 2Amp to 10V, 6.5Amp.Using USB Power Delivery (USB PD) it is a technology that allows for variable power output and flexible charging of devices. It also allows for reverse power flow, which means that a device can also charge another device or even a battery. A microcontroller can be used to control and regulate the charging process, in order to implement variable power output. PIC microcontrollers (ex. Linear Technology’s LTC4055, Texas Instruments’ bq2429x, Maxim Integrated’s MAX14526, NXP’s MC3467) are widely used in chargers due to their low cost, high performance, and easy-to-use programming.
* *Power requirement*: 10W to 100W.

[[_logistical_requirements]]
=== 3.2. Logistical Requirements
* *Packaging*: The charger should be packaged in a way that ensures it is protected from damage.
* *Durability*: Robust design to withstand frequent use and travel.
* *Portability*: For more portability, the LED light segment should be the first choice.
* *Labelling*: The charger should be clearly labelled with all relevant information, including the output voltage and amperage, safety warnings, and the name and contact information of the manufacturer.
* *Compliance*: The charger should comply with all relevant regulations and standards regarding storage, handling, and transportation. It should also be BIS(Bureau of Indian Standards) approved.
* *Laboratory and Testing*: To test the charger, we need testing equipment like DSO, multi-meter, power supply, function generator, and precision soldering tools. The components need to be tested to prevent breakdown.
* *Manufacturing*: The product has to be manufactured by a third manufacturer, or the body gets 3D printed in Lab.
* *Components*: We need step-down transformers, Diodes, capacitors, resistors, wires, transistors, and a PIC microcontroller.

[[_environmental_requirements]]
=== 3.3. Environmental Requirements
* *Temperature range*: -10℃ to 60℃.
* *Humidity*: Chargers must be able to operate in a range of humidity levels, typically between 20% and 90%.
* *Water resistant*: Charger’s edges and ports need to be rubber sealed, to prevent the circuit from water.
* *Altitude*: Chargers must be able to operate at a range of altitudes, typically up to 2,000 meters above sea level.
* *Shock and vibration*: Chargers must be able to withstand a certain level of shock and vibration without damage or malfunction.
* *EMI/EMC*: Chargers must meet electromagnetic interference (EMI) and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) standards to ensure that they do not interfere with other electronic devices.
* *Safety Standards*: Chargers must meet safety standards to ensure that they do not pose a risk of fire or electric shock.
* *Energy efficiency*: Chargers must meet energy efficiency standards to minimize energy consumption and reduce environmental impact. Minimize No Load power consumption.

[[_structural_requirements]]
=== 3.4. Structural Requirements
* *Dimensions:* The Dimensions of the charger should be around (6cm*6cm*4cm).
* *Plug Type:* The charger should be *2-pin plug(Type C)* (2-pin plugs are widely used in India, but it is important to make sure it is BIS approved for safety and compliance)
* *Material and Design:* The *material* and design of the charger should be such that it should be able to withstand a fall from a height of 2m or less. Some people like to keep their mobile phones on top of the charger so adequate design changes should be made to the adapter. Also, we now need to make sure that the heat generated in the charger shouldn’t be transferred to the mobile phone, in that case, the material chosen should have better insulation properties than a standard one. For this polycarbonate, casing seems to be the best considering price, drop strength, and weight.
* *Adapter-cable joint:* The adapter-cable joint is made to disconnect when a jerk is applied quickly but to remain firmly attached otherwise, protecting the phone from damage during tripping.
* *Length of cable:* The length of the cable should range from 3 to 4 feet. The cable should be tangle free.
* *Wire thickness:* The wire in it should be thick enough to work at 65 W but not more than that. It should also have the option for sending data from computer to phone and vice versa(data cable). It should be durable enough such that even if someone treads on it, it remains safe and should also withstand a load of minimum 150N. It should be a USB 3.X cable with USB C type connector. To ensure we can charge a range of devices, it’s best to go with 2A ports at minimum.
* *Charger pins:* Pins should be made of a material that has low cost, good electrical resistivity, and good wear resistance. For this Brass seems to have a mix of all three properties and hence it should be used
* *Location of port:* It should be front rather than on the side after considering spacing (both in real life and along the board), aesthetics
* *Label Information:* Brand name and logo, Input and output voltage and current specifications, Type of connector, Compatibility, Safety certifications and standards (e.g., IBS), Product dimensions and weight, country of origin, instructions for use and safety precautions Warranty or guarantee information.
* *Casing Opening:* The charger case will open from the rear end, keeping the area near the pins fixed to ensure easy assembly. moreover, the transverse cross-section of the charger will be fixed to protect from dust and moisture and structural integrity

[[_features]]
=== 3.5. Features
* *Safety Features*: Over-current, over-voltage, and short-circuit protection.
* *Efficient Charging*: Optimised for quick charging of mobile devices.
* *Magnetic Cables*: Materials used for the connector which attaches to the device’s charging port are made of metals like aluminum or stainless steel, and the cable itself is usually made up of copper, and the cable jacket is made of PVC or TPE, the magnets inside the connector are made of neodymium, samarium cobalt and others that have high magnetic properties.ge at

[[_power_and_safety]]

== 6. Power and Safety

[[_power_specifications]]

=== 6.1 Power Specifications

* *Source*: AC adapter.
* *Input*: 220V, 50Hz.
* *Output*: 2.1A, 5W(Normal Charging)/20W(Fast Charging).
* *Input Power factor*: 0.7.

[[_safety_specifications]]

=== 6.2 Safety features
--
* *Over voltage protection*: Varistors are used as suppressors to
protect devices and circuits from transient abnormal voltages, including
an ESD (electrostatic discharge) and a lightning surge. Leaded disk
varistors and SMD disk varistors are suitable for protection from a
relatively large surge current (100A to 25kA).
* *Short Circuit Protection*: A circuit breaker is used here to break
the circuit from the power supply separating the load from the power
supply in a short time (cutoff time).
* *Over Current Protection*: The charging current is controlled by a
switch/transistor connected in parallel with the photovoltaic panel and
the storage battery (Current sensing circuit). Overcharging of the
battery is prevented by shorting (shunting) the PV output through the
transistor when the voltage reaches a predetermined limit.
