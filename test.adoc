= 3. Abstract
In this requirement report, you will find the implementation of a solution which increases the efficiency of the Solar Panel. This idea focuses on sustainable energy development through utilisation of various engineering techniques. The model is inspired by the idea of solar tracking, like a sunflower. The model allows the user to convert it from a stationary unidirectional solar cell to a rotatable solar cell, generating more power than a conventional system, without the need of external assistance, which ease the installation process, increasing the scalability of product.

[[_Rotational_Appratus]]
== 4.a Rotational Apparatus

*Dual axis of Freedom:* Dual-axis solar trackers adjust the angle of solar panels
in two dimensions, resulting in higher efficiency than single-axis
trackers. They produce 45-50% more power annually compared to stationary
panels. The solar trackers must rotate from -180 to 180 degrees so that
they can maintain an optimal angle to the sun throughout the day and
year, which can result in higher power output compared to fixed-tilt or
single-axis solar panels.

*Efficient Motors:* At least two motors would be required. One would
rotate the panel on the horizontal axis and the other across the
vertical axis. The power requirements for the motors should be low.
RPH(rotations per hour) required for each horizontal and vertical axis
motor would be a minimum of 0.088. The motor should produce a minimum
torque of 0.1N-m.

*Economical to manufacture:* The parts for the rotational apparatus
should be economical to manufacture. Various parts, such as the motor
and gears, should be inexpensive to avoid heavy production costs. Spur
gears may deliver excellent efficiency at low speeds, and they are straightforward and
inexpensive.

*Controllers:* Arduino can be used to control the motor and its rotation
speed and direction. By using light sensors or GPS modules, an Arduino can determine the position of the sun and adjust the angle and orientation of the solar panel to ensure that it is always facing the sun.

== 4.b Apparatus
[[_Apparatus]]


*Mounting material:* Stainless steel, aluminum, and galvalume are
commonly used for solar mounting structures. Mounting racks can also be
made from different materials, with many manufacturers using aluminum
due to its low weight, corrosion resistance, strength, and compatibility
with solar module frames made of aluminum. It's important to know about
the material of mounting structures to avoid post-project issues.


*Structural Strength:* Structure should at least satisfy a minimum
ASCE-7 10 safety standards threshold. It should be able to handle a wind
load of about 200 N and a torque of 0.1 N-m. *Strong enough rods for them
to support this structure.


*Cost-Effective:* The apparatus should be economical to
manufacture. The material of mounting structures should be inexpensive
to avoid heavy production costs. Plastics-made mounting racks can be a
viable option for structure mounting.

== 4.c Embedded Systems
[[_embedded]]
*Micro-processors:* We intend to use a microcontroller like Atmega328, capable of running at low power, and simultaneously able to control and analyse incoming analog data from multiple sensors, hence computing solar direction. It should be able to give instructions to the motor driver for precise movements hence able to output PWM signals to the motor controller.

*Sensors*: Photoresistors / Light dependent resistors are generally used to detect light. Analysing their analog output gives us the direction of direct sunlight. We require sensors consuming low voltage and power, and able to generate analog output based on intensity of sun. GPS chip can also be utlized to determine the precise longitude and latitude of the location.
